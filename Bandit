Notes: Text in '' or " " IE, 'ls' or "./-" indicate commands to be typed in the terminal window.

Level 0>1
  Specify username/port and connect to SSH: 'shh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p2220'
  Enter noted PW at prompt: 'bandit0'
  
Level 0>1
  Once connected on level 0 you need to find the 'readme'. The 'ls' command at the prompt will list the files in the directory. 
  To view the content, use the following: 'cat readme'
  boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1
  'exit'
  
Level 1>2
  The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory
  'ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p2220'
  'cd /home'
  'ls'
  We are on Level1 so 'cd bandit1' (This is assuming the file would be there)
  Alternate option: "find './-'"     
  'cat ./-' 
  CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9
  'exit'
 
 Level 2>3
  The password for the next level is stored in a file called spaces in this filename located in the home directory
  'ssh bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p2220'
  cd /home
  cd /bandit2
  cat 'spaces in this filename' 
  UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK
  'exit'
  
 Level 3>4
  The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.
  'ssh bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p2220'
  cd /home
  cd /bandit3
  ls -a
  cat .hidden
  pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFgAB
  'exit' (be sure to exit every SSH session prior to entering a new one, leaving this off from now on)
  
 Level 4>5
  The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.
  'ssh bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p2220'
  'cd /home'
  'cd /bandit4'
  'cd/ inhere'
  Option1: You could "cd" for each directory to find it.
  Option2: You could move back up to /bandit4 and 'cat ./*' to see the PW mixed in with all the other stuff.
  Option3(best): from /inhere "run file ./-*" to see that file07 is ASCII, then 'cat ./-file07'

    The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:
    human-readable
    1033 bytes in size
    not executable
    'ssh bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p2220'

    'find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c'
    Produces a plethora of text, find: ./var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
    'cat ./var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password'   
    HKBPTKQnIay4Fw76bEy8PVxKEDQRKTzs
        
    
 Level 7>8
  The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth
  'ssh bandit7@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p2220'
  'ls'
  shows that data.txt is in the pwd
  'grep -i millionth data.txt'
   millionth	
  
Level 8>9
  The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt and is the only line of text that occurs only once
  'ssh bandit8@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p2220'
  'cat data.txt | sort | uniq -u'
  UsvVyFSfZZWbi6wgC7dAFyFuR6jQQUhR
  
Level 9>10
  The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, beginning with several ‘=’ characters.
  'ssh bandit9@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p2220'
  'grep -a '[[:alpha:]]' data.txt | sort -i' OR, a better way: "strings data.txt | grep '==='"
  ========== truKLdjsbJ5g7yyJ2X2R0o3a5HQJFuLk
  
Level 10>11
  The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which contains base64 encoded data
  'ssh bandit9@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p2220'  
  base64 -d data.txt
  The password is IFukwKGsFW8MOq3IRFqrxE1hxTNEbUPR
  
 Level 11>12
  The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions
  'ssh bandit9@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p2220'
  'cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m''
  The password is 5Te8Y4drgCRfCx8ugdwuEX8KFC6k2EUu
  
Level 12>13
  The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work using mkdir. For example: mkdir /tmp/myname123. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)
  "mkdr /tmp/name"
  "cp data.txt /tmp/name"
  "xxd -r data.txt test"
  "file test"
  "mv test test.gz"
  "gunzip test.gz"
  "ls"
  "file test"
  "mv test test.bz2"
  "bzip2 -d test.bz2"
  "file test"
  "mv test test.gz"
  "gunzip test.gz"
  "ls"
  "file test"
  "mv test test.tar"
  "tar -xvf test.tar" creates a data5.bin file
  "ls" 
   (continue using 'file' to see the compression type, then uncompress, repeat until you get an ASCII)
   The password is 8ZjyCRiBWFYkneahHwxCv3wb2a1ORpYL
