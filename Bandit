  'exit' (be sure to exit every SSH session prior to entering a new one, leaving this off from now on)
  
 Level 4>5
  The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.
  'ssh bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p2220'
  'cd /home'
  'cd /bandit4'
  'cd/ inhere'
  Option1: You could "cd" for each directory to find it.
  Option2: You could move back up to /bandit4 and 'cat ./*' to see the PW mixed in with all the other stuff.
  Option3(best): from /inhere "run file ./-*" to see that file07 is ASCII, then 'cat ./-file07'
